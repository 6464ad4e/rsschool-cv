### About me:


I am 27 years old as of 2022. I studied at the Russian State University of Oil&Gas named after I.M. Gubkin, and after my graduation I was hired by Eriell Group as a drilling engineer. I have worked for 5 years on my position, but the work brought me no pleasure and joy. Having seen that no changes were expected, I decided to find another path in my life. And so I found the RS School.
My goal is to become a frontend developer and enhance the life conditions of my family.

> You have cultivated a plant, and after months of hard work, the time has come to reap the flowers of your hard work. When it was growing, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time check how much your plant has grown.
> Your task is to return a string representing the plant.


```
function plant(seed, water, fert, temp){

  let plants = '';
  
  if (temp < 20 || temp > 30) {
    for (let j = 0; j < water; j++) {
    plants += '-'.repeat(water);
    }
  return plants + seed;
  }
  
  if (temp => 20 && temp <= 30) {

    plants += '-'.repeat(water) + seed.repeat(fert);
    }
  return plants;
